#  Portfolio

A showcase of my projects and experience as an Information Science student at RV College of Engineering. This portfolio highlights my work in web development and machine learning.

> This portfolio is built on top of [dillionverma's portfolio template](https://github.com/dillionverma/portfolio), which uses Next.js 14, shadcn/ui, and magic ui. The original template has been customized and extended to showcase my projects and experience.
